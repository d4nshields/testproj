# Welcome

  A test project for running unit tests on GitHub Actions is a project that is specifically designed to run unit tests on a codebase whenever a new commit is pushed to a repository. It usually consists of a workflow file in the repository, which contains a list of actions to be taken when a new commit is made. These actions often include running unit tests, linting code, and other quality-assurance tasks. The project does not actually do anything useful itself, but it does help ensure that code is working correctly and is high quality before it is released into production.
